#Yukon ver.1.10
Yukon is a Bootstrap-based Cotonti Siena admin theme designed and built to augment or replace the standard one.
The idea behind the project was to allow Cotonti Siena users to access main administration tools via mobile devices (smartphones or tablets), as well as rework usability and add minimalistic design to the back-end.

##Installation
1. Download and copy the theme into the themes/admin/yukon folder
2. Alter the admintheme variable in the cpnfig.php"
```$cfg['admintheme'] = 'yukon';		// Put custom administration theme name here```
