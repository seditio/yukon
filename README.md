# Yukon ver. 2.00b
Bootstrap-based Cotonti Siena admin theme

## Description
The Yukon theme was designed and built to augment or replace the standard one. The idea behind the project was to allow Cotonti Siena users to access main administration tools via mobile devices (smartphones or tablets), as well as rework usability and add minimalistic design to the back-end.
Besides the reworked .tpl files of the standard admin theme Yukon contains templates for the admin parts of the following modules:
- forums
- page
- pfs
- polls

and the following plugins:
- autoalias2
- banlist
- bbcode
- catlist
- comlist
- comments
- contact
- hits
- feedback
- hits
- ipsearch
- maintenance_alert
- pagelist
- r301
- ratings
- referers
- tags
- topiclist
- trashcan
- urleditor
- userimages

## Installation
1. Download and copy the theme into the themes/admin/yukon folder
